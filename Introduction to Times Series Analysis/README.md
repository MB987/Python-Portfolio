# Introduction to Time Series Analysis

In this folder you can find the ipython / jupyter notebooks *.ipynb* and the *data* I created and used to teach Time Series Analysis on an introductory level at university.
The notebooks explain the time functionality of the package `pandas`.
Statistical methodology will be added soon.
