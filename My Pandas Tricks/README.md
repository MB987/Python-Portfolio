This project demonstrates the 21 best tricks I have learned while using the python data analysis package pandas.

The jupyter notebook **'Best_Pandas_Tricks.ipynb'** is the jupyter notebook which contains these tricks as executable code and with markdown comments/instructions. You can also view the rendered notebook on nbviewer: [Link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MB987/Python-Portfolio/blob/master/My%20Pandas%20Tricks/Best_Pandas_Tricks.ipynb)
Th folder **'Data Input'** contains the datasets I have used to demonstrate the pandas tricks in the notebook.
