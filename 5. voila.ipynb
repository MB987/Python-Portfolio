    "The goal of Project Jupyter is to improve the workflows of researchers, educators, scientists, and other practitioners of scientific computing, from the exploratory phase of their work to the communication of the results.\n",
    "But interactive notebooks are not the best communication tool for all audiences. While they have proven invaluable to provide a narrative alongside the source, they are not ideal to address non-technical readers, who may be put off by the presence of code cells, or the need to run the notebook to see the results. Finally, following the order as the code often results in the most interesting content to be at the end of the document.\n",
    "Another challenge with sharing notebooks is the security model. How can we offer the interactivity of a notebook making use of e.g. Jupyter widgets without allowing arbitrary code execution by the end user?\n",
    "We set ourselves to solve these challenges, and we are happy to announce the first release of voilà.\n",
    "\n",
    "Voilà turns Jupyter notebooks into standalone web applications.\n",
    "Voilà supports Jupyter interactive widgets, including the roundtrips to the kernel.\n",
    "Voilà does not permit arbitrary code execution by consumers of dashboards.\n",
    "Built upon Jupyter standard protocols and file formats, voilà works with any Jupyter kernel (C++, Python, Julia), making it a language-agnostic dashboarding system.\n",
    "Voilà is extensible. It includes a flexible template system to produce rich application layouts."
