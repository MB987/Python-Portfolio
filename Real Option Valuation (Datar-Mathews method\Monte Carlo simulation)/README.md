The research goal of this project is to understand the practical use and application of Monte-Carlo simulations in the context of real investments. Real investments are used as the object of this research since they entail commonly and naturally the characteristics of an option. This makes the application of a Monte-Carlo simulation, such as in the process of applying the Datar-Mathews method for option valuation, a suitable approach.

The project makes use of a hypothetical case study, which is a gold mine investment:

*The company Gold Digger AG has a new investment opportunity: It can buy the right to extract gold from a previously inaccessible territory in Nigeria. With this extraction right, the company has the claim to mine gold from the gold ore that is known to exist in the territory for a period of five years once it starts the extraction. It will take the company one year, starting from the decision to launch the project to extract the first gold, until it will gain the first cash flows from the investment. The total Project Duration is therefore 6 years. The question the management of the Gold Digger AG asks and that is investigated further is whether it should purchase the extraction right and how much it should be willing to pay for it.*

For more information on the case study and the methodology, read the research paper: Paper_Real_Option_Valuation_using_the_Datar_Mathews_Method.pdf

The folder **'Data Input'** includes the inital gold price data in a .CSV file, which is used in the data analysis.

The folder **'Data Analysis'** contains the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), with the data visualisations and methodology (Monte Carlo simulation) and their result.
