# Scipy 2018 - Introduction to Geospatial Data Analysis with Python 

This repository is an introduction to geospatial data analysis in Python, with a focus on tabular vector data. It first focuses on introducing the participants to the different libraries to work with geospatial data and will cover munging geo-data and exploring relations over space. This includes importing data in different formats (e.g. shapefile, GeoJSON), visualizing, combining and tidying them up for analysis, and will use libraries such as `pandas`, `geopandas`, `shapely`, `PySAL`, or `rasterio`. The second part will build upon this and focus on more more advanced geographic data science and statistical methods to gain insight from the data. No previous experience with those geospatial python libraries is needed, but basic familiarity with geospatial data and concepts (shapefiles, vector vs raster data) and pandas will be helpful.
Each of the notebooks contains exercises which test the prevoiusly introduced material. The notebooks *case-conflict-mapping.ipynb* and *case-gini-in-a-bottle-the-trump-vote.ipynb* are case studies which apply all of the introduced functions and methods.

## Installation notes

Following this tutorial will require recent installations of:

- Python >= 3.5 (it will probably work on python 2.7 as well, but I didn't test it specifically)
- pandas
- geopandas >= 0.3.0
- matplotlib
- rtree
- PySAL
- scikit-learn
- mgwr
- cartopy
- geoplot
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org)
