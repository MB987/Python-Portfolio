**FOR THOSE ONLY INTERESTED IN THE FINAL VISUAL, OPEN THE FILE: Bamberg (Germany) Temperatures 2005-2014 and 2015.png**

View the jupyter notebook on nbviewer: [Link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MB987/Python-Portfolio/blob/master/Data%20Visualization%3A%20Plotting%20Weather%20Data/Data%20Visualization/Data_Visualization_Temperature_Development_Germany.ipynb)

This project takes temperature data from two weather stations near Nuremberg/Bamberg, Germany and shows the maximum and minimum monthly temperatures from 2004 to 2014. Each monthly temperature of 2015 that was either higher or lower than in the previous 10 years is plotted on top.
This visual shows impressively how **extreme temperature records are far more likely today** than in the past.

The folder **'Data Input'** includes the inital weather data, as well as the geographical data of the weather stations used in .CSV files.

The folder **'Data Visualization'** contains the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), with the code to manipulate the data and create the visualization: Bamberg (Germany) Temperatures 2005-2014 and 2015.png
